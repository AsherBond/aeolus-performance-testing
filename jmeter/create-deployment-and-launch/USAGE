STEPS
1. Download and install jmeter 
2. Use the configure-and-create-users.sh script to cleanup and configure aeolus and to create some test users
   ./configure-and-create-users.sh -u 5 -p ec2
3. Create a provider account in conductor
4. Start jmeter and open launch-fedora15.jmx

6. In HTTP Request Defaults, change "Server Name or IP" to localhost or a remote host
7.  Start the test

NOTES

The image build group executes a single thread to create an image that is then built and pushed.
The deployments created in the "instance launch group" uses this one image.

The push check only works for the mock provider.

The template is embedded as the image_xml parameter in the HTTP POST to /conductor/images.
